# Password-Generator
This repository contains two early password generators I created. One with the help of a tutorial and the other a derivative of it I created to make a secure password based off of a "Base word"
(The tutorial I used for version one: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLKQqipO2Mw")
